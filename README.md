Scripts for [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), maybe useful - maybe not.

## NoEmbarrassingMails.ahk

Outlook (starting with 2010) has the MailTips feature which warns you, e.g., when sending an email to too many recipients or to external recipients (outside your organisation).

Sometimes this will not work (option in configuration not enabled, offline Outlook, etc.). In these cases (and for the external recipients) this script comes to the rescue - after minimal customisation (see the source for that) and running it.

Besides from that, mainly a learning experience with autohotkey, so it may or may not be useful.
